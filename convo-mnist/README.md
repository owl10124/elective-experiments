# convo.cpp

As an extension I attempted to get a grasp of convolutional neural networks.

As it turns out convolution is more multiplication-based than anything.

Main resource: various. Brandon Rohrer's helped a lot.

## convo.cpp

Outputs to `net` by default. Should randomly generate network (`importnet(nullptr)`) or read from file (`importnet(file)`).

## test.cpp

Tests file (filename as argument).
