This is me testing out my neural network (which didn't work at the time).

test takes in an input (0/1) and outputs one of two neurons, indicating which the original input was.
test-3 takes in three inputs (0/1) and outputs one of four neurons (0,1,2,3) indicating its sum.

This precludes / occurs in 'parallel' with the MNIST testing.
